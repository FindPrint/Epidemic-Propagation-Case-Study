# ðŸ“‘ Epidemic Propagation Case Study â€” Plan

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ Scientific Rationale
- Epidemics are **complex dynamical systems**: they combine a deterministic trend (growth/decline of cases) with stochastic variability (super-spreader events, local outbreaks).  
- Traditional models:  
  - **Compartmental models (SIR, SEIR)** â†’ deterministic, structured.  
  - **Agent-based models** â†’ detailed but computationally heavy.  
- Your **Quadratic OU framework** offers a **lightweight, interpretable alternative**:  
  - Drift = epidemic wave shape (quadratic decline after peak).  
  - Noise = random fluctuations in case counts.  
  - Threshold = hospital capacity or epidemic resurgence.

## 2. ðŸ“Š Datasets (Public & Credible)

### Seasonal Influenza
- **WHO FluNet**: [https://www.who.int/tools/flunet](https://www.who.int/tools/flunet)  
  - Weekly influenza cases by country, since 1995.  
- **CDC FluView (US)**: [https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html)  
  - Weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) data.  

### COVID-19
- **Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Dataset**: [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)  
  - Daily confirmed cases and deaths, global coverage.  
- **Our World in Data (OWID)**: [https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)  
  - Cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing.

## 3. ðŸ”¬ Adaptation of the Equation

Equation (Quadratic OU):

\[
d\phi_t = -\gamma \, (\phi_t - \mu(t)) \, dt + \sqrt{2D}\, dW_t
\]

- \(\phi_t\) = normalized epidemic intensity (cases / population, or hospitalizations).  
- \(\mu(t)\) = quadratic drift (captures epidemic wave shape).  
- \(\gamma\) = reversion speed (how fast cases return to baseline).  
- \(D\) = stochastic variance (random shocks, local outbreaks).  
- Threshold = hospital capacity (ICU beds, ILI > epidemic baseline).  

---

## 4. ðŸ§ª Validation Filters

### Filter 1 â€” Data ingestion & normalization
- Normalize weekly cases by population or by baseline (e.g., 2010â€“2019 average for flu).  
- Produce \(\phi^*(t)\) series.  

### Filter 2 â€” Internal consistency
- Compare deterministic drift vs stochastic ensemble.  
- Check if OU captures both the epidemic curve and variability.  

### Filter 3 â€” Advanced validation
- **Benchmarks:** SEIR model, ARIMA, logistic growth.  
- **Out-of-sample:** Train on first half of epidemic wave, test on second half.  
- **Sensitivity:** Î³ and D grid search â†’ distribution of epidemic peaks.  
- **Robustness:** Compare across countries (e.g., US vs Spain vs Japan).  
- **Reproducibility:** Export CSV of predicted epidemic peaks and thresholds.

## 6. âœ… Expected Outcomes
- Show that the **Cosmic Tension Equation** can reproduce epidemic waves with fewer assumptions than SEIR.  
- Demonstrate robustness across **different diseases (flu vs COVID-19)** and **different geographies**.  
- Provide reproducible outputs (CSV, figures) for epidemic peaks and hospital thresholds.  
- Strengthen credibility by connecting to **public health datasets** and **peer-reviewed epidemic modeling literature**.
